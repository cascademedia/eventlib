Installation
------------
There are two ways you can install eventlib.

The easiest, and recommended, way of doing this is to install the package [through Bower](http://bower.io/).

Just create a bower.json file in your project:
```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "cascade-eventlib": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then, run the Bower command to install eventlib.
```
$ bower install
```

Alternatively, you can clone/download the repository and install the package manually.
